# Music-Recommendation-System
We have created an ontology-based music recommender that can offer personalized and diverse music suggestions to users based on their preferences. We used Protege, Celfie plug-in, and Apache Jena Fuseki to construct the ontology that represents the complex relationships between different music genres, styles, and moods. We implemented the system with Flask and web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a user-friendly interface.

NOTE: You should have a system (preferably VScode) which supports the use of libraries like flask and rdflib. After downloading the files, run the app.py file to start the live server. For more information you can visit the you-tube link given in the repository.
