# Music-Recommendation-System
Our system helps users discover songs that match their taste. It uses ontologies and web semantics to learn from the userâ€™s preferences, behavior, and past listening habits. It then recommends songs, albums, or artists that are popular in the genre or artist that the user chooses.
